# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview 
The manager at PyBer ride sharing company has given us a brand-new assignment to use our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Procedures & Results:

We started by converting the city data csv file and ride data csv files into Pandas Dataframes. We instected the data for any null values. Then we used the Pandas unique() function to find the types of cities in our city data.  There are three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.   Then we merged both DataFrames to do our analysis.  Later, we created separate Dataframes for each city to analyze riding trends and calcuations. Below is an example of total number of rides in Urban city:

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
